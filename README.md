# GCMS-Align-Peak-Table
Align peak areas for multiple samples based on user defined profile of features
https://github.com/BergmanME/GCMS-Align-Peak-Table

Instructions:
Download the code, make a profile for your data based on the provided template (.csv), have your output from MassHunter Qualitative Analysis using the export all integrated peak areas option (.csv), run AlignedPeakTable.py

Please let me know if you have any issues or suggestions for improvements.

Planned changes:
Remove necessity for user to input the type for data acquisition. ie remove query for ionization mode and scan settings. This can be automated by search the file for expected strings.
Add in trim for header lines in profile so that 'Start ' still works even if 'Start' was the intended text string.
